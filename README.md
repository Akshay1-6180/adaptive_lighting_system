# adaptive_lighting_system
Worked on a project as a group as a part of the course of Digital Design. <br> We designed an adaptive lighting system for our automobile, whose headlights turn on automatically as the ambient light reduces. Similarly the reverse would happen at day break and the light sensor measures light to dark in 8 levels.

This project was done as part of the Digital Design Course.
